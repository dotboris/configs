What is this?
=============

This repo contains config files that I use across diffrent systems.

Dependencies
============

Some of these configs depend on a number of plugins / apps. I'll try to keep a
list in here.

zsh
---

- zsh 5.x (last time I checked, 4.x didn't take it)
- oh-my-zsh

oh-my-zsh
---------

- zsh 5.x (the boris theme requires 5.x)

awesome
-------

- awesome wm 3.5.x (they broke the config when moving from 3.4.x)
- urxvt (terminal)
- opera (web browser)
- thunar (file browser)
- dmenu_run (improved run dialog)
- scrot (screenshots)
- wicd-client (autorun)
- numlockx (autorun)

This config also assumes that you have a keypad (to control the volume) and the
main volume channel is Headphones. These will change from platform to platform.
